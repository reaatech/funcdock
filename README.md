- üìä Real-time monitoring and dashboards
- üîí Security, alerting, and route conflict prevention
- üß™ Comprehensive testing and CI/CD support

## ‚ú® Features

- **Single Container**: All functions run in one Docker container
- **Hot Reload**: Automatic reloading with filesystem watching
- **Cron Jobs**: Scheduled task execution with timezone support
- **Git Integration**: Deploy functions directly from Git repositories
- **Smart Routing**: Custom routing per function with conflict prevention
- **Monitoring**: Built-in status monitoring and health checks
- **Alerting**: Integrated alert system with Slack support
- **Security**: Route conflict prevention and request validation

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Setup the platform
npm run setup

# 3. Start development server
npm run dev

# Or use Docker
make quickstart
# or
docker-compose up
```

## How It Works

- Place your functions in the `functions/` directory (each with its own handler, config, and optional cron jobs).
- FuncDock auto-detects, hot-reloads, and manages all functions in a single container.
- Use the web dashboard for real-time monitoring, logs, and management.
- Deploy from Git, local, or CI/CD with a single command.
