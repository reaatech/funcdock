# 🚀 FuncDock — The Revolutionary Node.js FaaS Platform

> **The first-ever FaaS platform with INSTANT hot reload, real-time dashboards, and zero-friction deployment — all your functions in one blazing-fast container.**

---

## 🔥 The Problem with Traditional FaaS

**Stop us if this sounds familiar:**
- 😩 Change one line of code → wait 3 minutes for cold deployment
- 🐌 Different dev/prod environments cause endless debugging
- 💸 Pay per function, per container, per everything
- 🌪️ Scattered functions across multiple services = management nightmare
- 📊 Zero visibility into what's actually happening

**There had to be a better way...**

## 🤯 Enter FuncDock: The Game Changer

FuncDock isn't just another FaaS platform — it's a **paradigm shift**. We've solved every pain point that makes serverless development frustrating:

### ⚡️ **INSTANT Hot Reload** — Industry First
Save your code and watch it go live **in milliseconds**. No builds, no deploys, no waiting. This changes everything.

### 🎛️ **Live Real-Time Dashboard** — See Everything
Watch your functions breathe with live logs, metrics, and health monitoring. Finally, true visibility into your serverless world.

### 🏠 **All Functions, One Container** — Revolutionary Architecture
Why manage 50 separate containers when one blazing-fast container can run them all? Massive cost savings, zero complexity.

### 🔄 **Perfect Dev-Prod Parity** — No More Surprises
What works locally works in production. Period. Same container, same environment, zero configuration drift.

## ⚡️ See The Magic In Action

### 1. Write a Function (It's That Simple)

```js
// functions/hello-world/handler.js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { logger, env, method, query } = req;
  logger.info('Hello handler called', { method, env: !!env });
  res.json({
    message: `Hello, ${query.name || 'World'}!`,
    env: env.MY_SECRET,
    time: new Date().toISOString()
  });
}
```

### 2. Add Intelligent Scheduling

```json
// functions/hello-world/cron.json
{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "name": "daily-greet",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * *",
      "handler": "cron-handler.js",
      "timezone": "UTC",
      "description": "Say hello every day at 9am UTC"
    }
  ]
}
```

```js
// functions/hello-world/cron-handler.js
export default async function handler(req) {
  req.logger.info('Cron job running!', { time: new Date() });
  // ...do your scheduled work
}
```

### 3. Experience Hot Reload Magic ✨

**Edit anything. Save. BOOM — It's live.** No builds, no deploys, no container restarts. This is the future of development.
