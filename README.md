> **The first serverless platform with INSTANT hot reload, CI/CD deployments, per-route handlers, real-time dashboards, and production-grade testing — all your functions in one blazing-fast container.**

---

## 🔥 The FaaS Problem Everyone Faces

**Sound familiar?**
- 😩 Change one line → wait 5 minutes for cold deployment
- 🐌 Different dev/prod environments = endless debugging nightmares
- 💸 Pay per function, per container, per lambda invocation
- 🌪️ Functions scattered across 20+ services = management chaos
- 📊 Zero visibility into what's actually happening in production
- 🧪 Testing serverless functions locally = impossible
- 🔄 Route changes require full redeployment cycles

**There had to be a revolutionary solution...**

## 🤯 FuncDock: The Serverless Game Changer

We didn't just build another FaaS platform — we **reimagined serverless development** from the ground up:

### ⚡️ **INSTANT Hot Reload** — Industry's First
Deploy your code and see it live in **milliseconds**. No container restarts, no downtime, no waiting. Git push → CI/CD deploys → functions hot reload instantly in production. Or deploy manually via CLI/dashboard and watch changes go live immediately. This changes everything about serverless deployment.

### 🎯 **Per-Route Handlers** — Revolutionary Architecture
Unlike every other platform, each route can have its own handler file. `/api` uses `api.js`, `/webhook` uses `webhook.js`, `/users/:id` uses `users.js`. Maximum code organization, zero complexity.

### 🎛️ **Live Real-Time Dashboard** — Complete Visibility
Watch your functions breathe with streaming logs, live metrics, route health monitoring, and cron job execution. Finally see what's happening in your serverless world in real-time.

### 🏠 **All Functions, One Container** — Cost Revolution
Why manage 50 containers when one lightning-fast container can run everything? **80% cost reduction** with zero architectural complexity.

### 🧪 **Production-Grade Testing** — With Docker Parity
Jest + Nock testing that runs in identical Docker environments. Test locally, deploy with confidence. No more "works on my machine" disasters.

## 🚀 Why Developers Are Obsessed

- **⚡ INSTANT HOT RELOAD** — Deploy → changes live in milliseconds (no other platform has this)
- **🚀 CI/CD READY** — Git push → test → deploy → hot reload in production with zero downtime
- **🎯 PER-ROUTE HANDLERS** — `/api` → `api.js`, `/users` → `users.js` (revolutionary organization)
- **👁️ REAL-TIME EVERYTHING** — Live logs, metrics, cron monitoring, route health
- **💡 ZERO CONFIG MAGIC** — Drop functions in, start coding, deploy anywhere
- **🐳 PERFECT DEV-PROD PARITY** — Same Docker environment locally and production
- **⏰ SMART CRON JOBS** — Per-function scheduling with timezone support and hot reload
- **🧪 PRODUCTION TESTING** — Jest + Nock in Docker containers matching production
- **🔒 ENTERPRISE READY** — Route conflict prevention, webhook validation, security headers
- **💰 MASSIVE COST SAVINGS** — One container to rule them all
- **🎨 PURE DEVELOPER JOY** — From idea to production in under 60 seconds

## ⚡️ Experience the Magic

### 1. Write a Function (Pure Simplicity)

```js
// functions/hello-world/handler.js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { logger, env, method, query } = req;
  logger.info('Hello handler called', { method, env: !!env });
  res.json({
    message: `Hello, ${query.name || 'World'}!`,
    env: env.MY_SECRET,
    time: new Date().toISOString()
  });
}
```

### 2. Configure Advanced Routing

```json
// functions/hello-world/route.config.json
{
  "base": "/hello-world",
  "handler": "handler.js",
  "routes": [
    { "path": "/", "methods": ["GET"] },
    { "path": "/api", "handler": "api.js", "methods": ["POST"] },
    { "path": "/webhook", "handler": "webhook.js", "methods": ["POST"] },
    { "path": "/users/:id", "handler": "users.js", "methods": ["GET", "PUT"] }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Add Intelligent Cron Jobs

```json
// functions/hello-world/cron.json
{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "name": "daily-backup",
      "schedule": "0 2 * * *",
      "handler": "cron-handler.js",
      "timezone": "UTC",
      "description": "Daily backup at 2 AM UTC"
    }
  ]
}
```

```js
// functions/hello-world/cron-handler.js
export default async function handler(req) {
  const { logger, cronJob, schedule } = req;
  logger.info(`Cron job started: ${cronJob}`, { schedule });
  // Your scheduled work here
}
```

### 4. Production-Grade Testing

```js
// functions/hello-world/handler.test.js
import { testHandler, expectStatus } from '../../test/setup.js';
import handler from './handler.js';

describe('Hello World Handler', () => {
  it('should return successful response', async () => {
    const { res } = await testHandler(handler, {
      method: 'GET',
      query: { name: 'FuncDock' }
    });
    
    expectStatus(res, 200);
    expect(res.body.message).toBe('Hello, FuncDock!');
  });
});
```

```bash
# Test in production-identical Docker environment
node scripts/test-function-in-docker.js --function=./functions/hello-world
```

### 5. Experience Hot Reload Magic ✨

**Deploy any way. Changes go live instantly.**

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Git push → automated tests → deploy → hot reload in production (zero downtime)
- **Manual CLI**: `make deploy-git` → functions reload instantly
- **Dashboard Deploy**: Upload via UI → see changes live immediately
- **Local Development**: File changes trigger automatic reload

No builds, no container restarts, no downtime. Routes, handlers, cron jobs, dependencies — everything hot reloads in milliseconds.

### 6. Deploy Like a Pro (Zero Downtime)

```bash
# Git-based deployments (perfect for CI/CD)
make deploy-host-git REPO=https://github.com/user/my-function.git NAME=my-function

# CI/CD Pipeline Integration
# Add this to your .github/workflows/deploy.yml:
# - name: Deploy to FuncDock
#   run: make deploy-host-git REPO=${{ github.repository }} NAME=my-function

# Local deployment (instant hot reload)
make deploy-local PATH=./my-function NAME=my-function

# Create new functions
make create-function NAME=payment-processor

# Update existing functions (zero downtime)
make update-function NAME=my-function

# Test in production-identical environment before deploy
node scripts/test-function-in-docker.js --function=./functions/my-function

# Watch everything happen in real-time
npm run logs
```

### 7. Monitor Everything Live

Your **real-time dashboard** at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/` shows:
- 📊 Live function performance metrics
- 📝 Streaming logs from all functions and routes
- 🔄 Route health and response times
- ⏰ Cron job execution history and status
- 🚨 Real-time alerts and error tracking
- 🎛️ Function management and controls
